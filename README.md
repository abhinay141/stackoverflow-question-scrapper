# stackoverflow-question-scrapper
Python program to scrape data from Stack Overflow to grab new questions (question title and URL),i have already given the xml path from where the data is scraped so for now it can only scrape questions from 2 particular xml paths.
The python library scrapy was used to scrape the data ,a library which is specifically used to scrape web pages.
scrapy is only the library which is used ,but it's actually the spider i created which actually does the magic of extracting questions from stack over-flow.
