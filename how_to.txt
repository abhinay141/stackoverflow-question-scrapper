New Scrapy project 'stack' created in:
    /stack-spider/stack

You can start your first spider with:
    cd stack
    scrapy genspider example example.com

open atom or any text editor for that matter(i personally recommend atom),and open your project folder
you should see the following files in your directory.
├── scrapy.cfg
└── stack
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── items.py
    ├── pipelines.py
    ├── settings.py
    └── spiders
        └── __init__.py
The items.py is used to define the data you want to scraped
and in the spiders directory create your spider(in my files,overflow_spider.py is the spider file)
